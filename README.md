An application that allows the user to search for and view current stock information. The user can search individual stocks by their ticker symbol; the search result includes a dynamic chart that displays current and past stock prices, which exchange the searched stock in traded on, and other relevent information about the stock's company. The user can add a stock to a watchlist that then displays the stock's most recent high low and close price.
